There are many challenges on the way there, starting from using as much HW acceleration as possible for completing low-level tasks through designing the best UX for this new usage scenario.\n\nDuring my time in Screenovate I\n- Led the architecture effort in the transition from a demoable PoC to a product\n- Instated work processes and tools in the development team\n- Managed the development team through an intensive project aimed at one of Japan's largest carriers\n- Researched and evaluated new technologies and platforms\n- Wrote lots of platform specific, low-level Android code (as well as some high-level stuff, too)\n- Solved some very nasty bugs",
